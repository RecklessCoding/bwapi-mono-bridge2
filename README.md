# bwapi-mono-bridge2
A BWAPI bridge to allow StarCraftAI to be build using Csharp

## Project Goal ##
The aim of this project is to allow people developing bots in a managed language to interface BWAPI without the need to create a wrapper themselves. SWIG offers great capabilities in keeping up with the constant changes in the original BWAPI.

## What to do? ##
* [Start here](https://github.com/suegy/bwapi-mono-bridge2/wiki)
* [Setting up](https://github.com/suegy/bwapi-mono-bridge2/wiki/StarCraft-Setup-BWAPI) StarCraft and BWAPI
* [Creating](https://github.com/suegy/bwapi-mono-bridge2/wiki/MonoBridge-Setup) the BWAPI-mono-Bridge2 to allow us to connect Csharp (or Java,ruby,Prolog) to StarCraft
* [Building](https://github.com/suegy/bwapi-mono-bridge2/wiki/CsharpAI) your first example bot in VisualStudio



## Acknowledgements ##
