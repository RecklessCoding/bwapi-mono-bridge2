## Project Goal ##
The aim of this project is to allow people developing bots in a managed language to interface BWAPI without the need to create a wrapper themselves. SWIG offers great capabilities in keeping up with the constant changes in the original BWAPI.

## First Steps ##
[SetupClientMode](SetupClientMode.md) explains how to get started with a first bot.




## About this project ##
This project is based on the original bwapi-mono-bridge http://code.google.com/p/bwapi-mono-bridge/ by dpershouse which seems to be no longer maintained.

It just updates the code so that you can run the latest version of BWAPI 3.7.4 with mono and Visual Studio 2010.

_[09/2014] We are currently thinking of upgrading the wrapper to be able to work with BWAPI 4.0.1_



The project was created so that other people can easily use BWAPI 3.7.4 with mono as well.
